With web services already being key ingredients of modern web systems,
automatic and easy-to-use but at the same time powerful and expressive testing
frameworks for web services are increasingly important. Our work aims at fully
automatic testing of web services: ideally the user only specifies properties
that the web service is expected to satisfy, in the form of input-output
relations, and the system handles all the rest. In this thesis we present in
detail all the components which form this system: how the WSDL specification
of a web service is used to automatically create test case generators and
properties that can be fed to PropEr, a property-based testing tool, to create
structurally valid random test cases for its operations and check its
responses. Although the process is fully automatic, our tool optionally allows
the user to easily modify its output to either add semantic information to the
generators or write properties that test for more involved functionality of
the web services.
