Kostis Sagonas is an academic who is working in the area of programming
languages and systems. Has been heavily involved in the development
of Erlang and its implementation since 1999. At Uppsala University, he has led
the [development team](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/people.shtml)
of the [HiPE native code compiler](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/)
that nowadays is part of [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org). Together with
his students, first at Uppsala University in Sweden and more recently
at theNational Technical University of Athens in Greece,
he has proposed various changes and additions to the Erlang language (most
notably, bit-level pattern matching and bit-stream comprehensions, and the
language of type and spec declarations), and has contributed to its compiler
and runtime system.
Besides [HiPE](http://www.erlang.org/doc/hipe/index.html), he has designed
and implemented many software development tools for Erlang
([Dialyzer](http://dialyzer.softlab.ntua.gr),
 Typer<!-- (http://www.erlang.org/doc/typer.html)-->,
 [Tidier](http://tidier.softlab.ntua.gr),
 [PropEr](http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr), ...)
and has contributed bug fixes to many open-source Erlang projects.
