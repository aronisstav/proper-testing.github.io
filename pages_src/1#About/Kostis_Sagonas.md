Kostis Sagonas is an academic who is working in the area of programming
languages and systems. He has been heavily involved in the development
of Erlang and its implementation since 1999. At Uppsala University, he has led
the [development team](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/people.shtml)
of the [HiPE native code compiler](http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/)
that nowadays is part of [Erlang/OTP](http://www.erlang.org). Together with
his students, first at Uppsala University in Sweden and more recently
at the National Technical University of Athens in Greece, he has proposed
various changes and additions to the Erlang language (most notably,
[algorithms for binary pattern matching](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Papers/JFP_06.pdf),
the extension for [bit-level pattern matching and bit-stream
 comprehensions](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Papers/binary_comprehensions.pdf), and
the language of [type and spec declarations](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Papers/contracts.pdf)
that is [part of Erlang](http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/typespec.html)
and nowadays widely adopted in the language comminity.)
In addition, he has contributed to Erlang compiler and
[runtime system](http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Papers/scp_mm.pdf).
Besides [HiPE](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/hipe/index.html)
and its [ErLLVM](http://erllvm.softlab.ntua.gr) extension,
he has designed and implemented many software development tools for Erlang
([Dialyzer](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html),
 Typer<!-- (http://www.erlang.org/doc/typer.html)-->,
 [Tidier](http://tidier.softlab.ntua.gr),
 [PropEr](http://proper.softlab.ntua.gr),
 [Concuerror](http://www.concuerror.com),
 CutEr, ...)
and has contributed bug fixes to many open-source Erlang projects.
