Kostis Sagonas is an academic who has been heavily involved in the development
of Erlang and its implementation since 1999. At Uppsala University, he has led
the development team of the HiPE native code compiler that nowadays is part of
Erlang/OTP. Together with his students, first at Uppsala University and more
recently at the National Technical University of Athens, he has proposed various
changes and additions to the language (most notably, bit-level pattern matching
and bit-stream comprehensions, and the language of type and spec declarations),
and has contributed to its compiler and runtime system. Besides HiPE, he has
designed and implemented software development tools for Erlang (Dialyzer, Typer,
Tidier, PropEr, ...) and has contributed bug fixes to many open-source Erlang
projects.
