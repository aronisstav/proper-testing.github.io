PropEr is a tool for the automated, semi-random, property-based testing of
Erlang programs. It is fully integrated with Erlang's type language,
and can also be used for the model-based random testing of stateful systems.

Recent releases of PropEr also contain support for targeted property-based
testing, a powerful extension that brings techniques from search-based
testing into property-based testing.

tool.
