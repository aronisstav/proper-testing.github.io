<p>PropEr is a tool for the automated, semi-random, property-based testing of
Erlang programs. It is fully integrated with Erlang's type language, and can
also be used for the model-based random testing of stateful systems.</p>

<p>Recent releases of PropEr also contain support for targeted property-based
testing, a powerful extension that brings techniques from search-based testing
into property-based testing.</p>
